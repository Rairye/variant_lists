# Collection of lists of variant characters. (So-called "confusables" or "confusable characters").

## Credits:

All lists, unless otherwise noted, were manually created by me. These lists can be used in conjunction with a fuzzy match search package that I manage.

### misc_latin.txt

The file "misc_latin.txt" was generated using a script that utilizes the confusables package found at https://github.com/woodgern/confusables

That package incorporates the unicode confusables list found at https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/8.0.0/confusables.txt
